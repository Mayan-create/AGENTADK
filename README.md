# 🚀 Multi-Agent AI System Using Google ADK

This project implements a modular multi-agent system that takes a user goal, generates a plan, and routes data between agents. Each agent enriches the output of the previous one to ultimately satisfy the user’s objective.

## 📌 Example Use Case

**User Goal:**
> "Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location, then summarize if it may be delayed."
